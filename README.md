# Choose an Editor

[Choose an Editor](http://tague.me/editor) is an intelligent quiz. It quizzes
you on what you're looking for in a text editor. Based on your preferences, it
selects a single editor to present to you as your ideal text editor.

This quiz is currently in a beta stage and contains very few editors, and only
a few questions. Contributions are very welcome, especially if you're adding
a lesser-known editor into the mix!
